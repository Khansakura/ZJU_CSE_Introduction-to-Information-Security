Requirements:  
Two asymmetric encryption algorithms, RSA and Elgamal, were used to achieve encrypted communication between Alice and Bob, and the encrypted communication using RSA algorithm was visualized. Our group divided information transmission into two situations: one is that the sent information needs to be kept confidential, and the other is that the sent information does not need to be kept confidential. The entire process mainly includes Alice sending a public key to Bob, Bob using public key encryption to send files to Alice, and Alice using private key decryption to receive data.
We also design the UI, although it is very simple.
